# Overview

Cardigann provides a way to connect popular tools like Sonarr, SickRage and CouchPotato to your favourite torrent trackers. It does the heavy lifting of scraping those sites (which are mostly HTML) and offering a consistent view to tools via the [Torznab](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/wiki/Implementing-a-Torznab-indexer) and [TorrentPotato](https://github.com/CouchPotato/CouchPotatoServer/wiki/Couchpotato-torrent-provider) protocols.

It's implemented in Golang and is fast, memory-effecient and available on all platforms. ðŸš€
